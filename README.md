# nba_stats
Messing around with some NBA stars from B-Ball reference.  Looking to see if I can predict success based on first couple season's performance.  Of particular interest are probably yearly player stats, where I've copied the BBALL ref total tables for 1990-2019.


Note that while all the code here is my own work (or probably eventually including some copying from Stack Overflow), the stats are all copied verbatim from basketball-reference.com, and so any license they have applies here.
