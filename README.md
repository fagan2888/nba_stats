# nba_stats
Messing around with some NBA stars from B-Ball reference.  Looking to see if I can predict success based on first couple season's performance.  Of particular interest are probably `yearly_player_stats/` and `playoff_player_stats/`, where I've copied the BBALL ref seasonal totals tables and the basic stats for all of the playoff series in each season for 1990-2019 by hand.

Note that while all the code here is my own work (or probably eventually including some copying from Stack Overflow), the stats are all copied verbatim from basketball-reference.com, and so any license they have applies here.

After some early exploration, I found those stats to be insufficient for my purposes, and decided to contribute in other ways as well, so I put in some work on a fork of [jaebradley](https://github.com/jaebradley) scraper (my version available [here](https://github.com/sheagk/basketball_reference_web_scraper)) to download stats automatically (with a delay to avoid overloading BBall-Ref's servers -- see [download_stats.ipynb](download_stats.ipynb).  However, I'm not going to put the results of those stats on this repo, as that strikes me as going a step too far in terms of making public the work of other people.  As such, the actual training data etc. will not be available in this repository (though you can reproduce it if you so choose).
